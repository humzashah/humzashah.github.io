## Work Experience

### **Staff Software Engineer** at [Credit Karma](https://creditkarma.co.uk), London<br/>
#### Since July 2019 to now<br/>

I am attached to multiple teams to provide platform and product engineering leadership. In recent months, I have led the UK team's migration from Linkerd to Envoy and I have led the implementation of features to comply with GDPR.

My current area of focus is platform security and data encryption using Gemalto's hardware security modules.

### **Senior Software Engineer** at [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk), London<br/>
#### From September 2016 to July 2019<br/>

At Deliveroo, I played an instrumental role in multiple projects.

In the Logistics Algorithms team, I worked closely with data scientists on Deliveroo's famous rider dispatch algorithm - [Frank][frank]; soon afterwards, I led the design and development of the company's first framework to train statistical models - [Canoe][canoe].

In the platform team, I reduced datastore costs, built load-source observability, and helped transition from monolith to service oriented architecture.

My last few months were spent in the Payments group, adding support for new payment providers and improving the build-times of the central monolith.

### **Tech lead** at [Innovation Enterprise](https://www.theinnovationenterprise.com/), London<br/>
#### From September 2015 to August 2016<br/>

I secured IE's online content, set up reliable continuous deployments for online services, and built the company's first data pipeline consolidating its various data sources.

### **Software Engineer** at [OmniScriptum](https://www.omniscriptum.com/), Saarbr√ºcken<br/>
#### From May 2014 to September 2015<br/>

I worked in a small team to develop features for multiple Ruby-on-Rails websites, used by authors to submit books to be published.

### **Software Engineer** at [ProtonLabs](https://www.facebook.com/protonlabsofficial/), Lahore<br/>
#### From November 2012 to April 2014<br/>

I joined senior engineers to build and maintain [HedgePo](http://www.hedgepo.com) (now [Allocator](http://www.allocator.com)). The product connected hedge fund managers with investors; we built it using Ruby-on-Rails, MySQL, Heroku, and CoffeeScript.
